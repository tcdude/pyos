Ad-Free Simple Solitaire game for Android

Annoyed by the ads in the average smartphone game, I decided to take a 
stab at yet another Klondike/Solitaire clone for Android, exploring 
[python-for-android](https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android) to see
if I can create a decent version of such a game. My main goal is to be able
to take a break without unnecessary commercial interruption.
